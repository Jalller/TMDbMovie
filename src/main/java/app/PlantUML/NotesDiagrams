📌 Explanation of Each Diagram
✅ 1. Class Diagram
🔹 Relevance:

Shows the structure of your application, including entities, DTOs, services, and repositories.
Helps in understanding relationships between classes (e.g., MovieDTO, Movie, MovieService, MovieRepository).
Essential for maintaining and expanding the project.
✅ 2. Sequence Diagram
🔹 Relevance:

Shows how objects interact during movie fetching and saving.
Helps debug request flow from TMDb API to your database.
Useful for troubleshooting unexpected behavior.
✅ 3. Component Diagram
🔹 Relevance:

Shows how components (MovieService, Utils, MovieRepository, Database, TMDb API) communicate.
Useful for understanding dependencies and refactoring the project.
✅ 4. Activity Diagram
🔹 Relevance:

Represents workflow from fetching movies to saving them in the database.
Helps in visualizing decision points (e.g., skipping movies with missing data).
✅ 5. Use Case Diagram
🔹 Relevance:

Helps understand user interactions, such as fetching and storing movies.
Useful for high-level project planning.
✅ 6. Deployment Diagram
🔹 Relevance:

Shows how the application runs (Spring Boot application, database, external API).
Helps in understanding server and deployment setup.
✅ 7. Object Diagram
🔹 Relevance:

A snapshot of objects at runtime (e.g., Movie, MovieDTO, MovieRepository).
Useful for debugging and verifying how objects hold data in memory.
❌ 8. State Diagram
🔹 NOT RELEVANT

Your application does not have complex states that change over time.
More useful for applications dealing with state transitions (e.g., login/logout, order status).
❌ 9. Wireframe Diagram
🔹 NOT RELEVANT

Only needed if you had a UI (like a web app).
Your project is backend-focused.
❌ 10. Mindmap Diagram
🔹 NOT CRITICAL

Can help with brainstorming project structure, but not necessary for coding.
❌ 11. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
🔹 NOT CRITICAL

More useful for project management, not necessary for actual implementation.
❌ 12. YAML Data Diagram
🔹 NOT RELEVANT

You are using JSON from TMDb API, not YAML.
❌ 13. EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form)
🔹 NOT RELEVANT

Used for defining programming language grammars, not useful for your project.
